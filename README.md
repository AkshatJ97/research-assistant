# Research Assistant

**Research Assistant** is an AI-powered Chrome extension and backend service that streamlines research tasks directly within your browser. It provides advanced text processing featuresâ€”such as summarization, paraphrasing, topic suggestion, citation generation, and definition lookupâ€”through an interactive side panel, backed by a Spring Boot server that integrates with Google Gemini for state-of-the-art AI language capabilities.

---

## Features

- **Summarize**: Condenses selected text into a clear, concise summary.
- **Paraphrase**: Rewrites selected content in simpler, alternative language.
- **Suggest**: Offers related topics and further reading suggestions.
- **Generate Citation**: Instantly generates APA-style citations for the current page.
- **Define**: Provides definitions for selected words/phrases.
- **Research Notes**: Lets users take, save, and export research notes in TXT or DOC formats.
- **Local Storage**: Persists notes between sessions using browser storage.

## How It Works

The system consists of two main parts:

- **Chrome Extension (`research-assistant-ext`)**
  - Presents a side panel with interactive controls.
  - On user action, captures selected text or page metadata.
  - Sends a request to the backend service for processing.
  - Displays AI-generated results directly in the side panel.
  - Allows users to take and export personal research notes.

- **Backend Service (`research-assistant-sb`)**
  - REST API built with Spring Boot.
  - Receives processing requests from the extension.
  - For citation generation, creates simple APA-style citations using page title and URL.
  - For other operations (summarize, paraphrase, suggest, define), crafts a prompt and delegates to the Gemini LLM API.
  - Parses LLM responses and returns the result to the extension.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- **Chrome Extension** (Manifest V3)
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Uses Chrome APIs: `sidePanel`, `storage`, `scripting`, etc.

**Backend:**
- **Spring Boot** (Java 21)
- **WebFlux** for reactive HTTP API calls
- **Google Gemini LLM API** (requires API Key/URL via environment variables)
- **Jackson** for JSON handling
- **Lombok** for boilerplate Java code

---

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21+** and **Maven** for backend
- **Chrome** browser (latest version) for extension
- **Google Gemini API Key** and endpoint URL

### Setup

#### 1. Start the Backend

```bash
cd research-assistant-sb
# Set environment variables for Gemini API (or edit application.properties)
export GEMINI_URL='https://YOUR_GEMINI_ENDPOINT/'
export GEMINI_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### 2. Load the Extension

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable "Developer Mode".
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `research-assistant-ext` folder.
4. The "Research Assistant" icon will appear in your browser's extensions panel.

#### 3. Using the Assistant

- Select text on any webpage.
- Click the Research Assistant extension icon to open the side panel.
- Click any of the available action buttons (Summarize, Paraphrase, Suggest, Cite, Define).
- Results will appear in the panel.
- Use the notes section to save or export your own notes.

## Details

- **End-to-End Solution:** Demonstrates full-stack development skillsâ€”custom Chrome extension, RESTful backend, and integration with LLM APIs.
- **Modern Technologies:** Utilizes Manifest V3, Chrome side panel API, Java 21, Spring Boot 3.x, and reactive programming with WebFlux.
- **AI Integration:** Abstracts prompt engineering and Gemini model invocation into a reusable backend service.
- **Robust UX:** Includes persistence (local storage), file export, and real-time API results for an efficient research workflow.
- **Scalable Design:** API-driven architecture makes it simple to swap out the language model or expand functionality.

---

## Customization & Extensibility

- **Adding Operations:** Extend `ResearchOperation.java` and update prompt crafting logic in `ResearchService.java`.
- **Alternate LLMs:** Swap Gemini endpoint with any LLM that accepts similar prompts and responses.
- **UI Enhancements:** The side panel HTML/CSS and JS are modular for easy branding and feature additions.
